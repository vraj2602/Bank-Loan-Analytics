5. Key Features and Insights
A. Business Problem

Banks manage large volumes of loan applications and repayments across multiple customer segments. Raw datasets make it difficult to track:

- Monthly funded loans?

- Good vs. bad loan percentages?

- State-level lending performance?

- Interest rate variations?

- High-risk loan purposes?

A centralized analytics dashboard was needed to improve monitoring and strategic decision-making.

B. Dashboard Objectives

- Consolidate all major lending metrics

- Track applications, funded amounts, and payments in real time

- Segment performance into Good Loans and Bad Loans

- Identify trends using time-series visuals
